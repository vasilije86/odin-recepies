    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The flavors of a good BLT are always on my instantly crave-able list but when I'm thinking of lunches that are easy to pack. I honestly think a wrap works better than a sandwich—it has less edges for stuff to fall out, after all! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound bacon</li>
        <li>1 head butter lettuce, leaves roughly chopped</li>
        <li>3 small ripe tomatoes, sliced</li>
        <li>6 large burrito-size tortilla wraps</li>
        <h4>For the chive mayo</h4>
        <li>1/2 cup mayo</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh chives</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Preheat oven to 375˚F.</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Cook the bacon: </h4><p>Arrange the bacon on a few baking sheets with foil or elevate them on a wire rack, making sure the bacon is not overlapping.</p><p>Bake the bacon for 15-20 minutes until it’s browned and crispy. Then remove the bacon from the baking sheet and let it drain on a few paper towels.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Make the chive mayo: </h4><p>In a medium bowl combine the mayo, chives, lemon juice, garlic powder, and salt. Set aside.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Assemble the wraps:</h4><p>Spread about 2 tablespoons of the chive mayo onto your wrap. Then layer with butter lettuce, tomato slices, followed by 3-4 strips of crispy bacon. </p><p>Fold the edges over on the wrap and roll it into a tight cylinder. Cut the wrap in half for easier eating.</p><p>Continue until all wraps are assembled.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Packing the wrap for lunch: </h4><p>Roll the wrap tightly in foil and keep it in the fridge until you leave. I like to pack the wraps in a bag with a cold pack, but they are fine wrapped up for a few hours also. I think the wrap is best when the lettuce is nice and crispy and cold. </p><p>Wrap ingredients all keep well in the fridge for 1 week. Make wraps on the day you are eating them!</p></li>
