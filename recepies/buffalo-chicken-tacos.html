    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These Buffalo chicken tacos are one of my favorite ways to bring the flavors of the classic wings to my own weeknight dinner table. They come together in under 20 minutes thanks to grocery store shortcuts like rotisserie chicken and bagged coleslaw mix. Even better, you don't need to turn on the oven or stove. It's a no-sweat, family-friendly dinner that is sure to become a regular on your roster.</p>
